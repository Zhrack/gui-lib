# Gui-lib
Simple in game UI system, used with SFML 2.3.2

This is a library done for myself, after searching for a good in game UI library and finding none that worked for me.
At the moment is in a working status and with an example application.

Features:
- Graphical theme support based on spritesheets and simple config file
- Widget structure
- Event callback system
- Good library of ready to use widgets.
- 9-patch graphics support
